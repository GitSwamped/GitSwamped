Welcome to **GitSwamped** — a safe swamp to get our Git hands muddy!  
This repo is a sandbox for practicing GitHub workflows, 3rd Party app integration, and repo setup.  

The goal:  
- Learn by doing (branching, committing, pull requests, merge conflicts).  
- Explore project structure and collaboration tools.  
- Build a reusable template we can carry into future projects.
